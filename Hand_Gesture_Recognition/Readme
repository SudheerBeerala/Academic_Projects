Business problem overview:
==========================
Consider a home electronics company which manufactures smart televisions want to develop a feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/imsparsh/gesture-recognition

This dataset has 5 gestures having 30 frames in sequence for each sample(video). Each video is a sequence of 30 frames (or images).

Each gesture corresponds to the following specific command:
Thumbs up: Increase the volume
Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
Left swipe: 'Jump' backward 10 seconds
Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
Stop: Pause the movie

I have built these below two models for sequence classification.
-CNN followed by GRU
-Convolution 3D network
